# Predict Rocket Launch Delays with Machine Learning

This project was Developed as part of a [learning path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/machine-learning-predict-launch-delay-nasa/) in Microsoft Learning, Predict rocket launch delays with machine learning. Is a very simple project with some foundations in data Data Preprocessing, and Machine learning. 

In this learning path, the goal was to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to discover weather patterns on days when rockets are successfully launched. By using those patterns, predict whether a launch is likely to happen based on specific weather conditions.

To achieve this a very simple Decision tree was implemented to make the predictions and the model was evaluated using Macro F1 Score. 

## Key Takeaways:

## Team Data Science Process lifecycle
The Team Data Science Process (TDSP) provides a recommended lifecycle that you can use to structure your data science projects.

### Five lifecycle stages
1. [Business understanding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle-business-understanding)
   + Specify the key variables that are to serve as the model targets and whose related metrics are used to determine the success of the project.
   + Identify the relevant data sources that the business has access to or needs to obtain.
1. [Data acquisition and understanding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle-data)
   + Produce a clean, high-quality data set whose relationship to the target variables is understood. Locate the data set in the appropriate analytics environment so you are ready to model.
   + Develop a solution architecture of the data pipeline that refreshes and scores the data regularly.
1. [Modeling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle-modeling)
   + Determine the optimal data features for the machine-learning model.
   + Create an informative machine-learning model that predicts the target most accurately.
   + Create a machine-learning model that's suitable for production.
1. [Deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle-deployment)
   + Deploy the model and pipeline to a production or production-like environment for application consumption.
1. [Customer acceptance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle-acceptance)
   + Finalize project deliverables: Confirm that the pipeline, the model, and their deployment in a production environment satisfy the customer's objectives.
