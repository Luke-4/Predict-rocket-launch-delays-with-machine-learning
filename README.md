## Team Data Science Process lifecycle
The Team Data Science Process (TDSP) provides a recommended lifecycle that you can use to structure your data science projects.

### Five lifecycle stages
1. [Business understanding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle-business-understanding)
   + Specify the key variables that are to serve as the model targets and whose related metrics are used to determine the success of the project.
   + Identify the relevant data sources that the business has access to or needs to obtain.
1. [Data acquisition and understanding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle-data)
   + Produce a clean, high-quality data set whose relationship to the target variables is understood. Locate the data set in the appropriate analytics environment so you are ready to model.
   + Develop a solution architecture of the data pipeline that refreshes and scores the data regularly.
1. [Modeling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle-modeling)
   + Determine the optimal data features for the machine-learning model.
   + Create an informative machine-learning model that predicts the target most accurately.
   + Create a machine-learning model that's suitable for production.
1. [Deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle-deployment)
   + Deploy the model and pipeline to a production or production-like environment for application consumption.
1. [Customer acceptance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle-acceptance)
   + Finalize project deliverables: Confirm that the pipeline, the model, and their deployment in a production environment satisfy the customer's objectives.
